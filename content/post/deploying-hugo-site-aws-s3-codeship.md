As you may have guessed looking at the footer of this site, I've started using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my static website engine. If you're interested in why I'm using one of those, rather than a classic database-driven blog engine, there are a [few](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/) [articles](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) on the subject.

The reason I chose Hugo is almost purely because it's written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), the main language I use both at work and for personal projects. This gives me some scope in making my own templates, or editing the templates of others, as well as contributing back to the project if there's anything I feel can be improved.

The great thing about deployment with statically generated sites is that there's no convoluted setup; once the files are generated by the system, you just throw them up onto a server or CDN. Simple. However, I wanted to be able to edit pages on the move, or create a new post directly from Github, and subsequently deploy these without needing access to a laptop. Enter continuous deployment.

[Codeship](https://codeship.com/) is a company that provide continuous integration and deployment as a service. With it, you can run tests, build projects, and then run deployment steps for specific branches (or branches with a given prefix). In this instance, it allowed me to upload Hugo-generated files up to AWS S3 once a change had been made to the `master` branch.
